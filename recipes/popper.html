        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                These jalapeño poppers are creamy in the middle with crispy bacon on the outside. They're easy to make and taste so much better than traditional poppers.
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup cream cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>12 jalapeño peppers, cut in length, no seeds or membranes</li>
            <li>12 slices of bacon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Mix cream cheese and Cheddar cheese together in a bowl until evenly blended. Fill each jalapeño half with cheese mixture. Put halves back together and wrap each stuffed pepper with a slice of bacon. Arrange bacon-wrapped peppers on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crispy, 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
