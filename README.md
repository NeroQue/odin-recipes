# odin-recipes
A recipe website using HTML

------------------------------------------------------

In this assignment I hope to test my HTML knowledge as well as practice using Git and GitHub. I will update this README as I go, probably share my thoughts and feelings too. At first I'll test if I remember the very standard HTML skeleton. I COULD use the "!" shortcut in VS Code but I'd rather take this chance to test how far I can go on my own.

------------------------------------------------------

Just finished the template, instead of looking everything up, I tried to do it from memory and I seem to have succeeded. I forgot to include the "lang" argument in the opening tag of <html>. I'll be pushing my first commit now.
